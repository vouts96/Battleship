# Battleship


Hello there,

This repo is about a fully functional battleship game writen and implemented in Java and JavaFX.

In order to play the game you will have to clone the repo and open it with Eclipse IDE.
Run it inside the Eclipse. Hopefully it will work.

So first of all you will need to load a scenario. Go to Application->Load and a window will open.
In the scenarios folder you will find some test scenarios. If you want to choose give as an ID
only the word after the underscore, without txt. For instance if you want to load player_default.text,
just write default.(I think this is the only you can play)

After that go to Application->Start and you will be asked if you want to start the game.
Click Yes.

Then you can fire your bolts from the bottom input writing coords x,y without parenthesis.

ENJOY!!
